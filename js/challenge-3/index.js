 Write a function which accepts a string representation of a number
 and returns the longest prime present in the string or null if
 no prime exists.

 For example, "130" should return 13. Remember, the string can be
 much larger than this so try to account for that in your implementation.

 What is the runtime complexity (Big O notation) of your solution?

	Input: A string
	Output: The largest prime or null if no prime exists
