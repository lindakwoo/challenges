    Write a function which accepts an array of numbers and a target value.
    Find the two numbers in the input array which sum to the target value
    and return their INDICES.

    Each input set should contain exactly ONE result. A single number can
    NOT be counted twice.

    Input: [0, 2, 5, 8, 12], 10
    Output: [1,3]

    Considerations:
      - This solution can be done with O(n) time complexity.
