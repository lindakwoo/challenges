# Challenges
This repository contains some coding exercises that will help to develop your skills as a Javascript developer. Each folder will contain a single challenge. Your goal is to solve the challenge and push a branch which contains your solution. 

# Recommendations
Although there are a lot of git GUI tools out there, I recommend using the git command line. It is an essential tool to be familiar with as you will not always have your GUI tool available to you! 

# How Do I Submit Solutions?
I have created a "solutions" directory for each challenge into which you should create your solution. Name your file <git username>-solution.js. When you believe your solution is complete, open a pull request to the master branch with your solution. Include me (jcampos8782) and whoever else you would like to review your code on the pull request. Once reviewed and the solution is correct, it will be merged to master. 
  
# Collaboration
Feel free to collaborate as much as you'd like. Thats the whole point of Git! Create whatever branches you need to whenever you need to. This is a workspace for you to learn with git and experiment with collaboration using source control.
